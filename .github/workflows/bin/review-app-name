# A small script to generate google-cloud-run app names
# using the branch name... which must meet certain criteria:
# - Service name must use only lowercase alphanumeric characters and dashes.
# - Cannot begin or end with a dash
# - Cannot be longer than 63 characters

# We'll use the 'TAG_SAFE_BRANCH' initialized by the `normalize-env-vars`
# script (run it before!)

tag_safe_branch = ENV['TAG_SAFE_BRANCH']

# Use the received arg and tag_safe_branch to generate the app name:
app_name = "#{ARGV[0]}-#{tag_safe_branch}"[0..62]

# Keep removing the final character until app_name no longer ends with a dash:
app_name = app_name[0..-2] while app_name[-1] == '-'

# Echo the app name:
puts app_name
